# barbajoe's mono repo

This repo contains the scaffolding (WIP) for three app and two libraries.

Apps:

- App 1 `src/apps/landing`: [barbajoe](https://barbajoe.tech/), this is a minimal landing page that displays the contents of my [github readme](https://github.com/Barbacoa08/Barbacoa08/blob/main/README.md).
- App 2 `src/apps/blog`: WIP, scaffolded [blog](https://blog.barbajoe.tech/) starter. I keep bouncing between frameworks (Next/Remix/SvelteKit/11ty/ect) and never getting a blog to a good enough place. More to come here (eventually... hopefully...).
- App 3 `src/apps/docs`: WIP, non-functional. I think I want to turn this into a larger static site for explaining deeper into how/why this mono-repo works.

Libraries:

- React Lib `src/packages/react-lib`: WIP, functional but not particularly useful or published to NPM/Deno
- Svelte Lib `src/packages/svelte-lib`: WIP, functional but not particularly useful or published to NPM/Deno
