# barbajoe's mono repo

This repo contains the scaffolding (WIP) for three app and two libraries.

Apps:

- App 1 `src/apps/landing` ([repo](https://github.com/Barbacoa08/barbajoe/tree/main/src/apps/landing), [live site](https://barbajoe.tech/)): an overview of my creations
- App 2 `src/apps/blog` ([repo](https://github.com/Barbacoa08/barbajoe/tree/main/src/apps/blog), [live site](https://blog.barbajoe.tech/)): WIP, scaffolded blog starter. I keep bouncing between frameworks (Next/Remix/SvelteKit/11ty/ect) and never getting a blog to a good enough place. More to come here (eventually... hopefully...)
- App 3 `src/apps/docs` ([repo](https://github.com/Barbacoa08/barbajoe/tree/main/src/apps/docs)): WIP, non-functional, I think I want to turn this into a larger static site for explaining deeper into how/why this mono-repo works

Libraries:

- React Lib `src/packages/react-lib` ([repo](https://github.com/Barbacoa08/barbajoe/tree/main/src/packages/react-lib)): WIP, functional but not particularly useful or published to NPM/Deno
- Svelte Lib `src/packages/svelte-lib` ([repo](https://github.com/Barbacoa08/barbajoe/tree/main/src/packages/svelte-lib)): WIP, functional but not particularly useful or published to NPM/Deno
