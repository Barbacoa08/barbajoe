# barbajoe's mono repo

This repo contains the scaffolding (WIP) for three app and two libraries.

Apps:

- App 1 `src/apps/landing` ([repo](https://github.com/Barbacoa08/barbajoe/tree/main/src/apps/landing), [live site](https://barbajoe.tech/)): an overview of my creations
- App 2 `src/apps/lib-staging` ([repo](https://github.com/Barbacoa08/barbajoe/tree/main/src/apps/lib-staging), [live site](https://lib-staging.barbajoe.tech/)): WIP, a staging environment for the libraries for testing and example usage.

Libraries:

- CSS Lib `src/packages/css-lib` ([repo](https://github.com/Barbacoa08/barbajoe/tree/main/src/packages/css-lib)): minimal css library that I've created so that I can stop copy-pasting my styling all over. Implemented in the barbajoe site, with plans to implement in the fighter-advice site.
- React Lib `src/packages/react-lib` ([repo](https://github.com/Barbacoa08/barbajoe/tree/main/src/packages/react-lib)): WIP, functional but not particularly useful or published to NPM/Deno
- Svelte Lib `src/packages/svelte-lib` ([repo](https://github.com/Barbacoa08/barbajoe/tree/main/src/packages/svelte-lib)): WIP, functional but not particularly useful or published to NPM/Deno.
